# Round The Corner
Iterates through each polygon and make it corners round.

## Motivation
In my company on of pcb best practice is all polygon corners must be round. And it's real hard to do because: no way to round all corner by click, no way to set round radius (or chord) value, no way to move sides after corner round (use need unround it, move side, round again). This script helps.
